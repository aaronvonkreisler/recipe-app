## Welcome to my Recipe App created on September 29th, 2020 ##

This application allows you to store and manage your favorite recipes. Each recipe has its own card, which you can click on to view the details. From there you can edit it by:

- Adding new ingredients
- Checking whether you have those ingredients in stock
- Adding meal attributes:
  - diet type
  - allergens
  - prep time

You can also generate a random recipe! Simply navigate to the "Random Recipe" tab and get directions, ingredients, a summary describing the meal, and more. 

TODO:
- [] Add functionality to save the randomly generated recipe to your recipes
- [] Fix formatting and layout of page
